## Study overview and goals

Identify clonal expansion of T-cells.
Ben Bimber is a collaborator of Steve's who does lots of TCR work in macaques.
He is a good reference for these inquiries and has some custom references with
additional data not present in IMGT. 

## Study design considerations

Ben suggests the rate of recovery can be broad. He suggested as high as 90%
clonotype recovery from T cells, whereas we observed sub 50% recovery in the
p23120 study. 

Multiple chains can appear in the same clone/cell. E.g. multiple alpha or beta
chains. This can be a product of the biology (possibly due to the first chain 
being non-functional) and not necessarily technical artifact. Depending on the
collapsing criteria, you may consider discordant alphas with matching betas 
as a clone with multiple chains. 

Bimber does some extra work with gamma delta chains, which we didn't get the
full details on for the p23120 study as they weren't relevant, but he has an 
extended reference for all the chains they've identified in their lab (including
gamma and delta chains).

## Workflow

There seems to be not a clear consensus on how to collapse slight differences
to call clones. It seems to be on a 'per study' basis.
