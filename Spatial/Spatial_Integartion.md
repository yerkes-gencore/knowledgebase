## Spatial Integration

While identifying spatial domains or cell types within a single tissue slice is valuable, there is growing recognition of the need for integrative and comparative analyses across multiple ST slices. These slices may originate from different individuals, biological conditions, technologies, or developmental stages.

However, combining data from multiple slices presents challenges due to batch effects—technical variations that can obscure true biological signals. Such effects may arise from:
	•	Uneven PCR amplification
	•	Variations in cell lysis efficiency
	•	Differences in reverse transcriptase enzyme performance during sequencing

To address these issues and facilitate multi-slice analysis, alignment and integration methods have been developed:
	•	Alignment methods aim to map spots or cells from different ST datasets to a shared spatial or anatomical reference. These are essential for correcting distortions and ensuring spatial consistency across tissue sections.
	•	Integration methods focus on combining datasets from different sources or conditions into a unified representation. This enhances robustness, mitigates technical variation, and enables the discovery of broader biological patterns not evident in individual slices.
